  Welcome to my site, It is still under construction. I am currently working on building up a large database of medical physics educational information, tools, programming tips, and just interesting things. Maybe I'll even build a game in here. 
</p>
<p>
  I will keep this page a simple journal until I think the site is closer to a finished product.

2/7/2024 - added a whole lot of QOL improvements to the site from a coding perspective. Seperated files by type, added some better commands. Added a resume as the main page. 

Next steps are to add more structure to the study page so that it's like a walk along study. I would like for it to contain animations and diagrams to make the topic as open as possible. 

I also want to work on the "asthetic" of the site as a whole. More grid based, more modern UI, looking at a ton of websites for inspo. </p>
