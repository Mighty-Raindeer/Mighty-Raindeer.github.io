<h1>Learning to Code</h1>
  
<p>
    I am not a trained programmer. In undergrad I learned some assymbly code and matlab. In 2019 I took an interest in python for creating a cryto trading bot. I followed along with many tutorials created by Part Time Larry on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/@parttimelarry). His casual and informative tutorials introduced me to the world of apis, dashboards, callbacks, and recursive functions. The project didn't make me rich, but it captured my interest for programming.

    During the pandemic of 2020, I took on a project for ct motion compensation. I learned how cts aquire, process, and display data to reverse engineer the process and create a system that uses the sinogram in order to produce images with no artifacts. This process was not novel by any standard, but provided a much deeper understanding of the technology.

    Later, a friend approached me for a project to gather clinical trials of a particular keyword ending soon for venture capital investment opertunities. I made a simple api webservice that produces a table for copying. the system worked well enough for their use.

    Once I joined ECU's medical physics residency program I began working on clinical automation and assistance. I created an EPID jaw junction calibration app that allows for the user to calibrate Truebeam jaws using encoder values and the radiation field to produce sub millimeter accurate jaw positions.

    Continueing, I created an onsite pylinac system that allowed for a QA backup system. I also began to work with c# for creating ESAPI apps. This is also when I began to familarize myself with Git more. If you notice my github contribution history, Around the time of 2023 is when I really start to use git commits a whole lot more. I modified many open source projects for clinical plan checks and dataminers to provide more clinical automation tools at a marginal price. I plan to continue and hopefully design a full Patient QA suite to allow for automatic patient QA reporting tools.

    In the present day I have started taking interests in creating a personal AI assistant. With the help of GPT, Copilot, and many other AI tools I have become a much more efficent programmer, physicist, and chef. There are many other oppertunities for AI to improve our lives that have not yet been implemented. I know I may not get there first, but I want to know what I'm using before it takes over the world.

    I learned how to create this website style and many other web development tools by watching fireship on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/@fireship). I have also learned a lot from the many other youtube tutorials and open source projects. I hope to continue to learn and create.
